# AI Agent Smart Matching: Multi-Source Precision Lead Generation for Orthodontic Equipment

#### **Background**

A medical equipment export client specializes in selling products to dentists in the United States. Their original marketing strategy primarily included:

* Investing **50,000 RMB per month** in social media advertising.
* Employing a **digital marketing team** to gather dentist names and profiles from clinic websites and ranking platforms, then matching them with social media accounts to obtain their contact details for outreach.
