# AI Agent Smart Filtering: Multi-Source Precision Sugar Mill Executive Identification

#### **Background**

The client is an international trade agent for domestic sugar demand, primarily aiming to find small and medium-sized sugar factories in countries like Brazil, Pakistan, and India. The main goal of the process is to use AI agents to view social media pages related to sugar factories, identify key executives, and match suitable executives based on the client's needs. The AI agent then cross-references multiple data sources to obtain the contact details of the factory's executives and relevant sales personnel. Ultimately, the AI agent successfully identified hundreds of sugar factories that met the client's requirements.

#### **Original Customer Acquisition Method and Pain Points**

Previously, the client relied on traditional manual methods to find sugar factories, using industry networks and trade events for contact. However, this approach faced the following challenges:

* **Limited Coverage**: Traditional methods, such as relying on industry contacts and attending trade events, only allowed access to a limited number of sugar factories.
* **Inefficient Contact Information Retrieval**: Finding contact details for key executives and sales personnel at sugar factories was a time-consuming process, requiring manual searching of information, which was inefficient and prone to errors.

#### **Solution: AI Agent Multi-Data Source Executive Identification**

To improve efficiency and accuracy, the client partnered with us to deploy an AI agent that automates the search across multiple data sources, matching sugar factory executives based on the client's specific needs. The solution includes the following key components:

1. **Multi-Data Source Data Collection and Analysis**
   * The AI agent is programmed to scan social media platforms, industry databases, and company websites to find potential executives and sugar factory information. The agentâ€™s search spans mainstream social media platforms as well as company websites.
   * By analyzing personal social media content related to sugar factories, the AI agent identifies key executives such as CEOs, CFOs, and other decision-makers.
2. **Smart Matching Using Multiple Data Sources**
   * The AI agent cross-references multiple data points (such as social media profiles, company websites, and business directories) to accurately identify executives and cross-verify their contact details, including email addresses and social media accounts.
   * The system matches key identifiers like job titles, company names, and locations to ensure that the identified executives meet the clientâ€™s criteria.
3. **Scalable Contact Information Retrieval**
   * The AI agent can automatically extract and organize the contact information of executives and related sales teams, streamlining the process of handling and managing large amounts of data.
   * The system is capable of handling searches across multiple countries (e.g., Brazil, Pakistan, India), making it easier for the client to access more markets.

#### **Results and Impact**

**ðŸš€ Significant Increase in Lead Generation Efficiency**

* Before using the AI agent, the client could only find a few executive contacts per month through traditional methods.
* After deploying the AI agent, the client was able to identify all sugar factories appearing online and gather accurate contact information for executives and sales teams, significantly increasing lead generation efficiency.
