# AI-driven Smart Identification of KOL IP Attributes and Precision Outreach

#### **Background**

A company aims to find female creators with IP attributes (i.e., personal brand influence) on major global social platforms such as Douyin and TikTok. They provide these creators with products to help them produce content.

#### **Previous Customer Acquisition Method & Pain Points**

The company initially relied on **MCN agencies** to find suitable KOLs/KOCs. However, MCN agencies operate entirely through manual processes, leading to several issues:

* **Low efficiency:** MCN agencies rely on manual efforts. A team of 10-25 people spends their days repeatedly searching, filtering, and contacting KOLs/KOCs, which limits efficiency.
* **Long acquisition cycles & slow response times:** Since the process depends on manual searching, filtering, and communication, finding the right creators is time-consuming and cannot keep up with business demands.
* **Lack of data transparency & optimization challenges:** Because contact tracking is handled manually in a fragmented manner, businesses have no direct access to KOL/KOC data. They must rely on MCN agency recommendations and cannot accumulate long-term marketing assets.

#### **Solution: AI Agent for Smart KOL/KOC Acquisition**
